What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?
A PureComponent in React is similar to a Component but implements a shallow comparison of props and state to determine if a re-render is necessary. A PureComponent automatically performs a shallow comparison on both props and state, and if neither has changed, it prevents the component from re-rendering.

You should use PureComponent when:

Your component's render output is purely determined by props and state.
You want to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
